            <p>Salesforce de-coded was born out of frustration with the gap between technical documentation and the real-world needs of everyday users.</p>

            <p>To provide practical, actionable advice for Salesforce end users who want to work smarter, not harder.</p>

                <h3>ðŸ’¡ Why we started this blog</h3>
                <p>We noticed that people struggle with Salesforce not because it's complicated, but because they don't know the practical tricks that make all the difference.</p>

            <h3>ðŸš€ Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p>We believe technology should work for you. Our goal is to bridge the knowledge gap with clear, practical advice you can implement immediately.</p>
