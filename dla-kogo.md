            </div>

            <h3>üéØ Perfect for these roles:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Developers</strong> - We don't cover coding, APIs, or custom development</li>
                    <li><strong>System Administrators</strong> - No configuration guides or org setup tutorials</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Architects</strong> - We focus on using Salesforce, not building it</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>You won't find technical implementation guides, code snippets, or admin configuration tutorials here.</em></p>
            </div>

            <h3>üí° What makes this different?</h3>
            <p>Most Salesforce content online is either too technical (for developers) or too basic (generic overviews). We focus on the middle ground - practical advice for people who use Salesforce every day to get their actual work done.</p>

            <h3>üéØ Our approach:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real scenarios</strong> - Tips based on actual day-to-day challenges</li>
                <li><strong>No jargon</strong> - Clear explanations without technical complexity</li>
                <li><strong>Actionable advice</strong> - Everything you read here, you can implement immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Role-specific content</strong> - Advice tailored to your specific job function</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Whether you're trying to hit your sales quota, improve your customer satisfaction scores, or just work more efficiently in Salesforce, you're in the right place!</p>
