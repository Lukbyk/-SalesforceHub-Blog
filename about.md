            <h2>Hi, I'm Lukas</h2>
            <p>I'm a Salesforce Business Consultant with over 15 years of experience in B2B sales and sales management.</p>

            <p>My journey with Salesforce started when I was a Global Product Owner, participating in an international Salesforce implementation. Later, I used Salesforce daily as a sales rep and then as a sales manager—experiencing the platform from both the user and leadership perspectives. This hands-on experience showed me what works in practice, what frustrates users, and where the real value lies.</p>

            <p>Two years ago, I decided to pivot my career and became a Salesforce business consultant, helping organizations optimize their sales processes and get more value from their CRM.</p>

            <h2>Why Salesforce Decoded?</h2>

            <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>I started this blog primarily to deepen my own Salesforce knowledge. There's something powerful about writing that forces you to truly understand a topic—you can't explain something clearly to others if you don't grasp it yourself. By building configurations, testing features, and documenting what I learn, I'm constantly pushing myself to understand Salesforce at a deeper level. The blog keeps me accountable and motivated to explore new areas of the platform.</p>

            <h3>Sharing Knowledge with Non-Technical Users</h3>
            <p>But learning alone wasn't enough—I wanted to share that knowledge with others who face the same challenge I did. Most Salesforce resources are highly technical, written for administrators and developers. But the people who use Salesforce every day—sales teams, customer service reps, product owners—need practical guidance that speaks their language.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>That's what Salesforce Decoded provides:</strong> clear, jargon-free explanations of how Salesforce actually works, why certain features matter, and how to use them effectively.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Real Examples, Real Testing</h3>
            <p>Every example, report, and configuration you see in these articles has been built and tested by me in actual Salesforce environments. I don't write about theoretical concepts—I write about solutions I've implemented and validated. If there's a report template or automation example in an article, you can trust it works because I've already done it.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box" style="border-left-color: #27AE60;">
                <p><strong>My goal is simple:</strong> help non-technical Salesforce users understand their system better, work more efficiently, and get more value from their CRM investment.</p>
