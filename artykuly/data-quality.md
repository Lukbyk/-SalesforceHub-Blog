            <h2>Keep Your Data Clean and Reliable</h2>
            <p>Keep your Salesforce data clean and reliable with proven strategies for validation rules, duplicate prevention, and data governance. Poor data quality leads to bad decisions and frustrated users.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Garbage in, garbage out. Clean data is the foundation of everything else you do in Salesforce.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Data Validation Rules</h3>
            <p>Set up validation rules to prevent bad data from entering your system. Require phone numbers to be in a standard format, ensure email addresses are valid, and make critical fields mandatory for specific record types.</p>

            <h3>Duplicate Prevention</h3>
            <p>Use Salesforce's built-in duplicate detection rules to catch potential duplicates before they're created. Set up matching rules based on company name, email address, and phone number to keep your database clean.</p>

            <h3>Regular Data Cleanup</h3>
            <p>Schedule monthly data review sessions. Look for incomplete records, outdated information, and obvious duplicates that slipped through. Create reports to identify data quality issues systematically.</p>

            <h3>User Training and Governance</h3>
            <p>Train users on data entry best practices. Create guidelines for how to enter company names, format addresses, and use picklist values consistently. Good data quality is a team effort.</p>

                <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>Use Data Loader or similar tools to bulk update common data issues. Don't try to fix everything manually - automation is your friend.</p>
