            <h2>The Challenge of Lead Management</h2>
            <p>Learn best practices for lead management that will help you increase conversion and better organize your sales process. Discover practical tips for lead qualification, follow-up strategies, and using Salesforce views effectively.</p>

                <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> A well-managed lead pipeline is the foundation of predictable revenue.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>1. Standardize Your Lead Qualification</h3>
            <p>Not all leads are created equal. Work with your team to define what a "qualified lead" means for your business. Use a simple framework like BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) and create custom fields in Salesforce to track this information.</p>

            <h3>2. Automate Follow-up Reminders</h3>
            <p>Never let a lead fall through the cracks. Use Salesforce Tasks or a Flow to automatically create a follow-up task for a sales rep a few days after a new lead is assigned. This ensures consistent engagement.</p>

            <h3>3. Leverage Custom List Views</h3>
            <p>Instead of looking at "All Open Leads," create targeted list views that help you prioritize. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"My New Leads Today"</li>
                <li>"Leads with No Activity in 7 Days"</li>
                <li>"High-Priority Leads from a Recent Webinar"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These focused views reduce noise and help reps focus on the most important actions.</p>

            <h3>4. Set Up Lead Scoring</h3>
            <p>Use Salesforce's built-in scoring features or create a simple point system based on lead behavior and demographics. This helps prioritize which leads deserve immediate attention.</p>

            <h3>5. Create Standard Follow-up Templates</h3>
            <p>Develop email templates for common scenarios: initial contact, follow-up after demo, nurturing cold leads. This ensures consistent messaging and saves time.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>Review your lead conversion rates monthly and adjust your qualification criteria based on what actually converts to customers.</p>
