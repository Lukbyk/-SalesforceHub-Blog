            <h2>Work Efficiently On-the-Go</h2>
            <p>Work efficiently on-the-go with mobile Salesforce features. The mobile app isn't just a stripped-down version of the desktop - it's designed for different use cases and workflows.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Mobile First:</strong> Think mobile-first when designing processes. What looks good on desktop might be clunky on mobile.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Essential Mobile Features</h3>
            <p>Use voice-to-text for quick note-taking during customer visits. The mobile app's camera feature lets you quickly capture and attach photos to records. Location services can automatically log where meetings took place.</p>

            <h3>Offline Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Download records you'll need when offline. The Salesforce mobile app automatically syncs changes when you reconnect. Plan ahead for client visits in areas with poor connectivity by caching relevant data.</p>

            <h3>Mobile-Optimized Workflows</h3>
            <p>Create mobile-friendly page layouts with fewer fields and sections. Use compact layouts to control what fields appear in list views and highlights panels on mobile devices.</p>

            <h3>Quick Actions for Common Tasks</h3>
            <p>Set up quick actions for common mobile tasks like logging calls, creating follow-up tasks, or updating opportunity stages. These appear prominently in the mobile interface and speed up data entry.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>Use the mobile app's integration with your phone's calendar and contacts. Salesforce can automatically suggest records when you receive calls from known contacts.</p>
