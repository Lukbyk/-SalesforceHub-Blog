            </div>

            <h3>Opportunity Stage Management</h3>
            <p>Define clear criteria for each sales stage. What specific actions or commitments must happen before an opportunity can move to the next stage? Document these criteria and train your team to follow them consistently.</p>

            <h3>Forecasting Accuracy</h3>
            <p>Use probability percentages that reflect reality, not wishful thinking. Track your team's historical accuracy and adjust probabilities based on actual win rates by stage. This leads to more reliable forecasts.</p>

            <h3>Activity Tracking</h3>
            <p>Log all meaningful interactions with prospects. Track calls, emails, meetings, and demos. This history helps you understand what activities correlate with winning deals and identify stalled opportunities.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Track competitors you're facing in deals. Use this data to identify patterns and develop strategies for common competitive scenarios. Knowledge is power in sales.</p>

                <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>Set up alerts for opportunities that haven't been updated in 14+ days. Stale opportunities hurt forecast accuracy and may indicate deals that need attention.</p>
