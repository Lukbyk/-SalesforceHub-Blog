            <h2>Automate Your Email Campaigns</h2>
            <p>Automate your email campaigns and follow-up sequences to nurture leads more effectively and save time. Learn how to set up triggered emails, drip campaigns, and personalized sequences that convert.</p>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Automated emails should feel personal, not robotic. Always include personalization and relevant content.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Setting Up Email Workflows</h3>
            <p>Start with simple triggered emails based on lead actions. When someone downloads a whitepaper, automatically send a follow-up email with related content. Use Salesforce Process Builder or Flow to create these automations.</p>

            <h3>Best Practices for Email Automation</h3>
            <p>Keep your sequences short and valuable. A 3-5 email drip campaign is usually more effective than a 15-email sequence. Space emails 2-3 days apart for B2B audiences, and always include a clear call-to-action.</p>

            <h3>Personalization That Works</h3>
            <p>Go beyond "Hi [First Name]" - use company name, industry, or recent activity to make emails relevant. Reference specific pages they visited or content they downloaded to show you're paying attention.</p>

            <h3>Testing and Optimization</h3>
            <p>Test subject lines, send times, and email content. Track open rates, click rates, and conversion rates to see what works best for your audience. Make small changes and measure the impact.</p>

                <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>Set up automation rules to stop sending emails if someone becomes a customer or requests to be removed from campaigns. Nothing kills credibility like irrelevant emails.</p>
