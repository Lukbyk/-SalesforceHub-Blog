            <h3>Popular Integration Platforms</h3>
            <p>Zapier and Microsoft Power Automate make it easy to connect Salesforce with hundreds of other apps without coding. Start with simple automations like syncing new leads from web forms or creating Slack notifications for closed deals.</p>

            <h3>Email Integration Best Practices</h3>
            <p>Connect your email system (Gmail, Outlook) to automatically log emails to Salesforce records. Set up email templates that pull data from Salesforce to personalize outreach at scale.</p>

            <h3>Calendar and Meeting Tools</h3>
            <p>Integrate your calendar app to automatically create events in Salesforce when meetings are scheduled with contacts or leads. This ensures all customer touchpoints are tracked in one place.</p>

            <h3>Marketing Automation Sync</h3>
            <p>If you use marketing automation tools like Mailchimp or Pardot, set up bi-directional sync to share lead scoring, campaign responses, and email engagement data with your sales team.</p>

                <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>Start small with integrations. Pick one workflow that causes the most manual work and automate that first. Success with small integrations builds confidence for bigger projects.</p>
