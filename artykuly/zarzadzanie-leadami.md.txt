                <h2>The Challenge of Lead Management</h2>
                <p>Learn best practices for lead management that will help you increase conversion and better organize your sales process. Discover practical tips for lead qualification, follow-up strategies, and using Salesforce views effectively.</p>

                <h3>1. Standardize Your Lead Qualification</h3>
                <p>Not all leads are created equal. Work with your team to define what a "qualified lead" means for your business. Use a simple framework like BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) and create custom fields in Salesforce to track this information.</p>

                <h3>2. Automate Follow-up Reminders</h3>
                <p>Never let a lead fall through the cracks. Use Salesforce Tasks or a Flow to automatically create a follow-up task for a sales rep a few days after a new lead is assigned. This ensures consistent engagement.</p>
