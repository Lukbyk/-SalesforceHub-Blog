            <h2>Build Dashboards That Drive Results</h2>
            <p>Build comprehensive dashboards that provide actionable insights for your sales team. A well-designed dashboard should tell a story about your sales performance and highlight areas that need attention.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Design Principle:</strong> A dashboard should answer questions, not raise them. Keep it simple and focused.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Dashboard Design Principles</h3>
            <p>Keep your dashboard clean and focused. Use the "5-second rule" - someone should be able to understand the key message within 5 seconds of looking at your dashboard. Limit yourself to 6-8 components maximum.</p>

            <h3>Key Metrics to Track</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lead conversion rates</strong> - Track how well you're converting leads to opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>Sales cycle length</strong> - Monitor how long deals take to close</li>
                <li><strong>Pipeline velocity</strong> - See how quickly deals move through stages</li>
                <li><strong>Win/loss ratios</strong> - Understand your success rates</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue by source</strong> - Know which channels are most effective</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Component Types That Work Best</h3>
            <p>Use charts that match your data type. Bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends over time, and gauges for single metrics with targets. Avoid 3D charts and fancy animations - they distract from the data.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>Create different dashboards for different audiences. Sales reps need daily activity metrics, while executives need high-level trend data.</p>
