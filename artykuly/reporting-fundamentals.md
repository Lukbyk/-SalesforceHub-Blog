            <h2>Master Report Creation</h2>
            <p>Master the basics of creating meaningful reports in Salesforce. Good reports don't just show data - they tell a story and help you make better business decisions.</p>

                <p><strong>Foundation:</strong> Every good report starts with a clear question you're trying to answer.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Report Types and Formats</h3>
            <p>Choose the right report type for your data. Tabular reports work best for lists, summary reports group data by categories, and matrix reports show data in rows and columns. Use joined reports to combine different objects in one view.</p>

            <h3>Effective Filtering</h3>
            <p>Use filters to focus on relevant data. Filter by date ranges, record types, or custom fields to get specific insights. Save time by creating report folders for different teams or use cases.</p>

            <h3>Custom Report Fields</h3>
            <p>Create formula fields to calculate metrics like days since last activity, deal size categories, or conversion rates. Bucketing fields let you group similar values together for cleaner analysis.</p>

            <h3>Scheduling and Sharing</h3>
            <p>Set up scheduled reports to deliver key metrics automatically. Share reports with the right people and consider creating public folders for company-wide metrics everyone should see.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>Before creating a new report, check if someone else has already built something similar. Reuse and modify existing reports instead of starting from scratch every time.</p>
