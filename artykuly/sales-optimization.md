            <h3>1. Automate Repetitive Tasks</h3>
            <p>Identify tasks your sales team does repeatedly and automate them. Use Salesforce Flows to automatically update opportunity stages, send follow-up emails, or create tasks based on specific triggers. This frees up time for actual selling activities.</p>

            <h3>2. Optimize Your Sales Pipeline</h3>
            <p>Review your current sales stages and ensure they reflect your actual sales process. Remove unnecessary stages, clarify criteria for moving between stages, and train your team on consistent stage management.</p>

            <h3>3. Leverage Sales Analytics</h3>
            <p>Use Salesforce reports to identify patterns in your sales data. Track metrics like average deal size, sales cycle length, and conversion rates by source. Use these insights to make data-driven improvements to your process.</p>

            <h3>4. Implement Lead Routing</h3>
            <p>Set up automatic lead assignment based on territory, product expertise, or workload. This ensures leads get to the right person quickly and prevents them from falling through the cracks.</p>
